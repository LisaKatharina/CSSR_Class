## Instructions and background information on our repository:

This repository contains the files of our research proposal for the course <a href="https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures" target="_blank">MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis</a> taught by <a href="https://github.com/christophergandrud
" target="_blank">@ChristopherGandrud</a> at the <a href="https://hertie-school.berlin" target="_blank">Hertie School of Governance</a>  in Fall 2015.

In addition to the Readme file, our repository contains two BibTeX files, a RMD file, a PDF file, an HTML file and a docx file. The PDF, the docx and the HTML file were created using the knit function of R Studio. The referenced literature can be found in the BibTeX file "Literature.bib". The R Packages used for the proposal are cited in the BibTeX file "Rpackages.bib". As the BibTeX files and the RMD file are dynamically linked, it is important to save all three files in the same folder when trying to run the RMD file.
